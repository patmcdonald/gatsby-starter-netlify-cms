Hey Chris,

Here's my selection from your [support-tasks gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6/raw/15f37be99e4fc3eb8caffa954472240a2a70847d/gistfile1.md).
To be honest, I found it hard to list my least favourite activities. Really!

My 5 favourite activities from this list are:

1. Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model

2. Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day

3. Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems

4. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before

5. Set up your own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging



My 5 least favourite activities from this list are:

1. Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product

2. Respond to Netlify fans on Twitter

3. Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.

4. Help manage communications during a service outage

5. Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub
